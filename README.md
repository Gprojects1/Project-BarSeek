An application built on microservice architecture, which can be used as an aggregator of restaurants (for now only bars) and dishes (for now only drinks) with the ability to write and leave a review for both a dish and a bar. Points are awarded for leaving a review. Points and the review itself can be used as a replacement for tips for service staff, as we are plannig to convert point into crypto-coins.
